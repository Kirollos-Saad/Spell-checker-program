# Spell-checker-program
This program was our Data structure 1 final project.<br>
This program works by implementing binary search tree (BST) algorithm.<br>
This program allows you to:<br>
1: Load existing English dictionary to the program.<br>
2: Let the user enter a word which could be spelled incorrectly.<br>
3: Searche for the entered word and checks if it is located in the dictionary.<br>
4: suggest ,if not found, the closest words for the user.<br>
 (These words are suggested by getting the Successor, Predecessor, and the word located in the last node of the BST).
